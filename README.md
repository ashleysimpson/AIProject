# ai-project

This was the final project submission for `COMP 424` Artificial Intelligence.

The task for this project was to create an AI to play [Mancala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala), a 2-player boardgame. The AIs created by the students were pitted against eachother and part of the project grade was decided by how well your AI did against the class.

We used the typical AI approaches for an introductory AI course in 2014 (Monte Carlo tree search, heuristic search, Alpha-Beta pruning). As with all projects from a University level course, do not expect much from the quality of the code.
